        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        <span1>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span1>
        <span2>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span2>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
        his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
        <redBold >What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù
        </redBold>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
        <redBold>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a
        flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp,
            even when he is asleep . . ."</redBold> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span1>I felt the need of
        protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span1>
